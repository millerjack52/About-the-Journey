## Introduction
"About the Journey" is an innovative mobile app designed to enhance the way travellers reflect on and share their travel experiences. 
This app helps tourists easily curate their adventures, turning their scattered photos and stories into visually appealing, shareable travel journals.

## Installation
Step-by-step instructions on how to install and set up the app:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://eng-git.canterbury.ac.nz/nfa44/about-the-journey.git`
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Obtain a Google Maps API key by following the instructions [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/get-api-key).
4. Create a secrets.properties file in the root directory of the project and add the following lines: `MAPS_API_KEY={YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY}`
5. Build the project. 
6. Run the app on an emulator or a physical device.

## Usage
- Our app is designed to create travel journeys and share them with friends.
- Travel journeys are created by adding points of interests with a selection of photos and a description.
- The app also allows users to view their journeys on a map and in a journal view.
- Users can share their journeys with friends via exporting and importing of journeys.
- The app also includes settings to enable dark mode, change the maximum number of photos per point of interest, and change how the duration of a journey is calculated.
